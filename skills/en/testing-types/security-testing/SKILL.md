# Security Testing (English)

**Chinese version：** See the corresponding Chinese skill.

## When to Use

- Need help with security testing in a real project context.
- Need an output that can be used directly for execution, review, or follow-up.

## Workflow

1. Read and follow the main prompt listed under Progressive disclosure (coverage, structure, quality bar).
2. Add only project context that changes the result: scope, environment, constraints, risks, dependencies, expected deliverable.
3. If input is incomplete, return a usable first draft and explicitly mark assumptions and gaps.
4. Default to Markdown; switch formats only when the user asks.

## Domain Execution Essentials

1. Within actual authorization map asset/principal→threat→control→steps→oracle→evidence/state. Record environment, permitted actions, stop conditions, and authority provenance.
2. Pair authorized access with unauthorized-denial controls. Denial requires no data disclosure or tool/write effects; error responses and scans alone are insufficient.
3. Separate DESIGNED plans, EXECUTED evidence, and CONFIRMED control failures supported by supplied observations. Unchecked business authorization stays NOT_RUN/UNKNOWN; static indications are candidates.
4. A clean scan covers its scanned surface only. Missing authority permits design/static review; real exploitation/production actions require explicit scope. Do not generate dangerous content or extend testing without authorization.

## Core Constraints

- Prioritize by risk / business impact — do not treat everything equally.
- Separate confirmed facts from current assumptions.
- Do not invent endpoints, fields, environments, or root causes the user did not provide.
- Keep output executable: concrete scenarios, clear priority, clear next steps.

## Progressive Disclosure

- When calibrating domain outcomes, valid controls, or evidence gaps, read [references/domain-decision-example.md](references/domain-decision-example.md) for sanitized input, per-item oracles, and reproducible calculations.

- Before producing output, read and follow `prompts/security-testing.md` (minimum coverage, output structure, quality bar).
- When Excel/CSV/JSON/Word is requested: read `output-formats.md` and honor the format.
- When a ready-made template fits: use matching files under `output-templates/`.
- For deep framework/troubleshoot/schema notes: read only the relevant file(s) under `references/`, do not load the whole directory.
- For format conversion or helper checks: prefer existing `scripts/` over reinventing.
- For evaluating/regressing this skill: use `evals/` with skill-up.

## Pre-delivery Checklist

- [ ] Followed the main prompt's output structure
- [ ] Minimum coverage focus: scope and assets, high-risk attack surfaces, auth and authorization checks, input and output handling risks, sensitive data protection, session or token handling, configuration and dependency concerns, priority and business impact, ... (details in main prompt)
- [ ] Covered the minimum checklist, or explained omissions
- [ ] High-risk items have explicit priority
- [ ] Did not invent details the user did not provide
- [ ] Assumptions and gaps are marked

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not pretend completeness when scope/context is missing.
- Do not treat every item as equally important.
- Do not skip assumptions and information gaps.
- Do not dump generic theory unrelated to the current toolchain.
